# LButtonScrollTB

Scroll by holding down the primary button on your pointing device without losing the ability to select text or drag and drop.

This is intended to be used with finger-operated trackballs to scroll by holding down the thumb button.

Installation:
Works on Windows only and requires you to install Autohotkey v1.x. Unpack the .zip file to a folder somewhere and run LButtonScrollTB.ahk. The other files are two Autohotkey dependencies and an icon file to be shown while in scroll mode.

Operation:
- Hold down the primary / left trackball (mouse) button and drag the mouse pointer in any direction for a distance of 50 pixel to engage auto-scroll. Scrolling mode will then begin automatically and will continue until you release the button.
- To select text or perform a drag-and-drop operation, hold down the left mouse button without moving the pointer until you hear the beep sound. This means that drag lock has been engaged. Now move the mouse pointer to drag an item or select text. Click the left button to drop the item or stop text seletion.

I hope you'll enjoy this as much as I do!
